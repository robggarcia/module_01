    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix olive oil, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper for marinade in a
        glass bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Begin paella: Add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate until
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet or paella pan over
        medium heat. Stir in garlic and pepper flakes, then stir in rice. Cook
        and stir until rice is coated with oil, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add saffron threads, bay leaf, parsley, chicken stock, and lemon zest.
        Stir until well combined and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low,
        cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the rice is cooking, heat olive oil in a separate skillet over
        medium heat. Stir in marinated chicken and cook for 3 minutes. Add onion
        and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add bell pepper and sausage; cook and stir, breaking sausage up with a
        spatula, for 5 minutes. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are
        bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread rice mixture onto a serving tray. Top with meat and seafood
        mixture.
      </li>

    <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As the main ingredient, rice is key to a great paella. Don't rinse it
        before adding it to the other ingredients! Keep it as starchy as
        possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        The beauty of paella is that all the flavors build upon one another as
        the dish comes together in one pan. Let the meat render fully so the
        flavorful fat coats the grains of rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paella can be as extravagant or as budget-friendly as you want it to be.
        Keep it simple with chicken and sausage or incorporate mussels,
        scallops, calamari, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once everything is assembled, avoid stirring it too much. Excessive
        stirring will create a creamy risotto â€” we're after a more pilaf-like
        texture.
      </li>
    </ul>

        <b>Glenn Lee: </b>I used chicken thighs, one per person, instead of
        pieces. I doubled the saffron and also cooked the sausage first and
        drained the fat. Keep extra chicken stock handy to moisten the rice if
        needed. THEN (a personal touch)I cooked about 3 dozen mussels and 3
        dozen clams and put on top of the dish. My guests raved and I'll do it
        again and again....I don't care if it's not authentic paella, it's a
        great entertaining dish and delicious...

        <b>Cheryl: </b>Great Paella "Corrorian"! Paella, no matter how you make
        it, is always a bit time consuming but in the end, it's certainly worth
        it. After marinating my chicken, I cut the chorizo into bite size pieces
        and browned. I removed the sausage, then browned the chicken and then
        the peppers and onions. Everything was put back into my dutch oven along
        with a large can of crushed tomatoes. I simmered the meat and vegetables
        for a good forty minutes. From there I added chicken stock and the rice.
        The dish was fabulous!
